The Programs empirically test the time complexity of sorting algorithms: quicksort, Insertion/Quick sort hybrid, radix sort and timsort, and insertion/deletion in self balancing trees: AVL tree and Red Black tree.

Run the Algorithms on cse machines
compile using g++
example: g++ file.cpp
run: ./a.out

or

compile: g++ -o outfile file.cpp
run: ./outfile
